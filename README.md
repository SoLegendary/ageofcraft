Inspired by classic Real-Time Strategy games like *Starcraft*, *Warcraft*, and *Age of Empires*, **Reign of Nether** transforms Minecraft into an RTS, using the game's iconic assets and models. It offers a unique blend of Minecraft mechanics and traditional RTS gameplay that fans of both genres will appreciate.

## Unique Features

*Reign of Nether* doesn’t aim to replicate other RTS games exactly. Instead, it incorporates distinctly Minecraft mechanics, creating a hybrid experience:

- **Building Health:** Structures’ health scales with the number of blocks placed, making size and durability intrinsically linked.
- **Vanilla-inspired Units:** All units are based on familiar Minecraft mobs, including Illagers, Creepers, and Piglins, offering a strategic twist on these well-known creatures.
